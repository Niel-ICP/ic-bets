# ICBets
The ICBets dapp is in development. The purpose of this project is to enable decentralized user created bets for all types of purposes.

The dapp is working locally for the default local browser user 2vxsx-fae

The reactjs interface was developed merely to be functional, it is able to display all the bets and allows users to bet, withdraw their bets, and collect winnings on won bets. 
It is still very much a work in progress, so some bugs are still present.
